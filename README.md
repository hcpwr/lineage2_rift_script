# Lineage 2 Rift Script

Script to automate farm in "Rift" location in Lineage 2 game. Writted for private server, contains IDs specific to that server.

# Usage
To use this script, you will need to slightly change IDs of NPCs and buffing logic, depending on your server features.

Due to limited ability to log in multiple clients, it is impossible to have 1 script for the whole farm. However, there are multiple ways to go around this issue, here I have multiple scripts, each done for specific client (based on the ingame class).
It is possible to do this using only 2 scripts but it will limit flexibility.
